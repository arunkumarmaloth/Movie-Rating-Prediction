# 🎬 Movie Rating Prediction

This project aims to predict movie ratings using machine learning techniques. Given a dataset of movie-related features, the model learns to estimate the rating a movie might receive. This can be useful for recommendation engines, content analysis, or data exploration in the entertainment industry.

## 🚀 Features

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Feature engineering
- Model training and evaluation
- Prediction visualization

## 🧠 Machine Learning Models Used

- Linear Regression
- Random Forest Regressor
- Gradient Boosting (if applicable)
- Performance metrics: MAE, RMSE, R² Score

## 🛠️ Requirements

Install the required packages before running the notebook:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Or manually install the core dependencies:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset should include features such as:

- Movie title
- Genre
- Budget
- Cast
- Director
- Runtime
- Release year
- IMDb or Rotten Tomatoes rating (target)

*(Make sure the dataset is properly cleaned and formatted before training.)*

## 📈 How to Run

1. Clone the repository
2. Open `movie_rating_prediction.ipynb` using Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab
3. Run the cells step-by-step to train and evaluate the models

## ✅ Results

The notebook will output key performance metrics and visualizations for evaluating model accuracy and prediction effectiveness.

## 📌 Future Improvements
- Add a web interface using Flask or Streamlit
- Integrate with a movie database API for real-time predictions
